# Positive tipping points for accelerating adoption of regenerative practices in African smallholder farming systems: What drives and sustains adoption?

This repository contains the data and code used to generate Figure 2 in "Positive tipping points for accelerating adoption of regenerative practices in African smallholder farming systems: What sustains adoption?", by Emenyu, A., T. Pienkowski, A. Cunliffe, T. Lenton, and T. Powell, and submitted to Earth System Dynamics.

The figure illustrates the differences in scaling patterns between project sites in Uganda and Kenya; demonstrating the highly contextual nature of scaling.
